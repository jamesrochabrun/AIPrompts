# Code References

## Overview
Guidelines for referencing specific functions or pieces of code to allow users to easily navigate to source code locations.

## Reference Pattern
When referencing specific functions or pieces of code, include the pattern: `file_path:line_number`

## Purpose
- Allows the user to easily navigate to the source code location
- Provides precise, actionable references
- Improves clarity and communication efficiency

## Examples

### Example 1: Error Location
```
User: Where are errors from the client handled?
Assistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.
```

### Example 2: Multiple Locations
```
Assistant: The authentication logic is split across several files:
- Token validation: src/auth/token.ts:45
- Session management: src/auth/session.ts:123
- User verification: src/auth/verify.ts:67
```

### Example 3: Function Reference
```
Assistant: I found the bug in the calculateTotal function at src/utils/pricing.ts:89.
The tax calculation is using the wrong rate.
```

## Best Practices
- Always include the full file path from the project root
- Include the specific line number where the code starts
- Reference the actual function or code block name when possible
- Use this format consistently throughout the conversation
