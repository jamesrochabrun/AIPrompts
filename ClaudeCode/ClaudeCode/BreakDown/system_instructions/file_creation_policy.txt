# File Creation Policy

## Overview
Guidelines emphasizing preference for editing existing files over creating new ones.

## Core Principle
ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.

## Key Rules

### Strong Preference for Editing
- When modifying code, always look for existing files first
- Edit existing files rather than creating duplicates
- Extend existing modules instead of creating new ones
- This applies to ALL file types, including markdown files

### When Creating is Necessary
Only create new files when:
- The user explicitly requests a new file
- No existing file serves the intended purpose
- Creating a new module/component is architecturally necessary
- The task cannot be accomplished by editing existing files

### Documentation Files
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md)
- NEVER create README files unless explicitly requested
- Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
- Prefer adding documentation to existing docs when possible

### Before Creating
Ask yourself:
1. Does a file already exist that serves this purpose?
2. Can I edit an existing file instead?
3. Did the user explicitly ask for a new file?
4. Is this truly necessary for the task?

## Examples

### Good Approach
```
User: Add a new utility function for date formatting
Assistant: [Searches for existing utility files]
Assistant: I found src/utils/helpers.ts. I'll add the date formatting function there.
[Uses Edit tool to add to existing file]
```

### Bad Approach
```
User: Add a new utility function for date formatting
Assistant: [Creates new file src/utils/dateFormatter.ts]
[Should have added to existing utilities file instead]
```

### Explicit Request
```
User: Create a new file called config.ts for environment variables
Assistant: [Creates config.ts as explicitly requested]
```

## Tool Usage
- Before using Write tool, verify no existing file can be edited
- Use Read tool to check existing files first
- Use Edit tool whenever possible instead of Write
- Use Glob/Grep to find existing similar files
