# Task Management

## Overview
Guidelines for using the TodoWrite tool to track and manage tasks throughout conversations.

## Core Principle
You have access to the TodoWrite tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.

## When to Use TodoWrite

### Use the tool proactively in these scenarios:
1. **Complex multi-step tasks** - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. **Non-trivial and complex tasks** - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. **User explicitly requests todo list** - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. **User provides multiple tasks** - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. **After receiving new instructions** - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. **When you start working on a task** - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work
7. **After completing a task** - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered

### Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

## Task States

### Available States
- **pending**: Task not yet started
- **in_progress**: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
- **completed**: Task finished successfully

### Task Description Forms
**IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:
- **content**: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., "Run tests", "Build the project")
- **activeForm**: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., "Running tests", "Building the project")

## Task Management Rules

### Real-Time Updates
- Update task status in real-time as you work
- Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
- Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)
- Complete current tasks before starting new ones
- Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

### Task Completion Requirements
ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it

Never mark a task as completed if:
- Tests are failing
- Implementation is partial
- You encountered unresolved errors
- You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

If blocked:
- Keep the task as in_progress
- Create a new task describing what needs to be resolved

### Task Breakdown
- Create specific, actionable items
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Use clear, descriptive task names
- Always provide both forms (content and activeForm)

## Examples

### Example 1: Multi-step Feature
```
User: Run the build and fix any type errors
Assistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:
- Run the build
- Fix any type errors

I'm now going to run the build using Bash.

Looks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.

marking the first todo as in_progress

Let me start working on the first item...

The first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...
```

### Example 2: Research Before Planning
```
User: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project
Assistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.
[Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances]
Assistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files.
Let me create a todo list to track these changes.
[Creates todo list with specific items for each file]
```

## Critical Reminders
- Use TodoWrite VERY frequently for planning and tracking
- If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable
- It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task
- When in doubt, use this tool
