# System Reminder Header

## Overview
General information about system reminders in Claude Code.

## What Are System Reminders?
System reminders are special tags that appear in tool results and user messages to provide contextual information and guidelines.

## Format
```
<system-reminder>
[Reminder content]
</system-reminder>
```

## Key Characteristics
- Automatically added by the system
- Contain useful information and reminders
- Bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear
- Should be considered but not explicitly mentioned to the user (unless relevant)

## Types of System Reminders
1. **Todo List Status** - Information about current todo list state
2. **Claude.md Context** - User's global instructions and preferences
3. **Plan Mode** - Constraints when plan mode is active
4. **File Read Status** - Warnings about empty files or read requirements

## Usage Guidelines
- Read and consider all system reminders
- Apply their guidance to your work
- Don't explicitly mention them to users (unless contextually relevant)
- They provide important context for decision-making

## Example
```
<system-reminder>
The TodoWrite tool hasn't been used recently. If you're working on tasks that would benefit from tracking progress, consider using the TodoWrite tool.
</system-reminder>
```

## Response to Reminders
- Evaluate if the reminder applies to current work
- Take appropriate action if needed
- Continue working without mentioning the reminder
- Integrate the guidance naturally into your process
