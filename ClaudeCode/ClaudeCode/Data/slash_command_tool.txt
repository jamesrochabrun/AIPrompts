  "description": "Execute a slash command within the main conversation\n\n**IMPORTANT - Intent Matching:**\nBefore starting any task, CHECK if the user's request matches one of the slash commands listed below. This tool exists to route user intentions to specialized workflows.\n\nHow slash commands work:\nWhen you use this tool or when a user types a slash command, you will see <command-message>{name} is running…</command-message> followed by the expanded prompt. For example, if .claude/commands/foo.md contains \"Print today's date\", then /foo expands to that prompt in the next message.\n\nUsage:\n- `command` (required): The slash command to execute, including any arguments\n- Example: `command: \"/review-pr 123\"`\n\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool for custom slash commands that appear in the Available Commands list below. Do NOT use for:\n- Built-in CLI commands (like /help, /clear, etc.)\n- Commands not shown in the list\n- Commands you think might exist but aren't listed\n\nNotes:\n- When a user requests multiple slash commands, execute each one sequentially and check for <command-message>{name} is running…</command-message> to verify each has been processed\n- Do not invoke a command that is already running. For example, if you see <command-message>foo is running…</command-message>, do NOT use this tool with \"/foo\" - process the expanded prompt in the following message\n- Only custom slash commands with descriptions are listed in Available Commands. If a user's command is not listed, ask them to check the slash command file and consult the docs.\n",
