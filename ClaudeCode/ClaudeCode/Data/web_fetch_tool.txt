  "description": "\n- Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model\n- Takes a URL and a prompt as input\n- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown\n- Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model\n- Returns the model's response about the content\n- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content\n\nUsage notes:\n  - IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions. All MCP-provided tools start with \"mcp__\".\n  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL\n  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS\n  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page\n  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files\n  - Results may be summarized if the content is very large\n  - Includes a self-cleaning 15-minute cache for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL\n  - When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL in a special format. You should then make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL to fetch the content.\n",
